919 Text Editor is a fork of 920 Text Editor from the last commit that was buildable using the F-Droid build system. The motivation behind forking 920 is because the project can no longer be built using the official F-Droid build system, since (as the application details page states on F-Droid) the upstream project now uses resources from the Android Open Source Project.

The particular reason for this initial fork is that the editor is crashing for tablets, and I would like to see this editor available for tablets. This fork should also be used for fixes against other major bugs.

Building
========
To build this application yourself, clone the project, and then run

 * ndk-build

in the project root. Then use the legacy Android Ant build system ("ant debug" for a debug version. A release version requires you to generate your own keys) or the legacy Eclipse ADT. It would be nice to update this project properly to use the new Gradle build system.

The README of 920 as it is from the latest commit on F-Droid is below.

920 Text Editor is a run on the Android phone a powerful text editor, anywhere, you can easily view or edit your code, you can also use it as e-book reader to open txt novel, it is like on Windows EmEditor, EditPlus so powerful.
